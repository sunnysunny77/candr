Heading 1 →,From The Supervisor,,,
Span 1 →,"My name is Naomi, over the last 14 years whilst I have been working within the cleaning industry, I experienced an ncreased frustration with how often cleaners were not provided with all the necessary procedures, training and realistic time frames to perform their work satisfactorily. Further exasperation watching greed and intense profit not shared with those doing the hard work, the cleaners! Eventually this vexation forced a realisation that I needed to be an independent business owner/operator to ensure the cleaners and clientele are cared for. I created a business where the cleaners do benefit from their efforts, financially and personally. A happy cleaner means a happy client. Both are very important to me.  
 <br/><br/>
 So here I am!
